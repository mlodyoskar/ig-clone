### Issue 15: Frontend - User Search and Discovery UI

**Title:** Frontend - User Search and Discovery UI

**Description:**

This issue covers the frontend implementation for user search and discovery functionality, allowing users to find and connect with other users on the platform through an intuitive search interface.

**Sub-tasks:**

- **Search Interface:**
  - Create a search page or component with a search input field.
  - Implement real-time search suggestions as users type (debounced to avoid excessive API calls).
  - Display search results in a clean, user-friendly format.
  - Show user avatars, usernames, and follow/unfollow buttons for each search result.
- **Search Results Display:**
  - Display search results with user profile pictures, usernames, and follower counts.
  - Show follow/unfollow buttons based on the current user's follow status for each result.
  - Implement pagination or "Load More" functionality for search results.
  - Handle empty search results with appropriate messaging.
- **Navigation and Integration:**
  - Add a search icon/button to the main navigation or header.
  - Make usernames in search results clickable, linking to user profiles.
  - Integrate with the existing follow/unfollow functionality from Issue 11.
- **User Experience Enhancements:**
  - Implement loading states while searching.
  - Provide clear feedback for search errors.
  - Add keyboard navigation support for search results.
  - Implement search history or recent searches (optional for MVP).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can access a search interface from the main navigation.
- Users can search for other users by typing in the search field.
- Search results are displayed in real-time as users type.
- Users can follow/unfollow other users directly from search results.
- Search results are properly paginated and handle large result sets.
- The search interface is responsive and provides good user experience.
