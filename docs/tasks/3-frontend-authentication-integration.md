### Issue 3: Frontend - Implement Authentication UI and Integration

**Title:** Frontend - Implement Authentication UI and Integration

**Description:**

This issue covers the development of the user interface for registration and login, and the integration with the backend authentication endpoints. It ensures users can interact with the authentication system.

**Sub-tasks:**

- **Registration Page (`/register`):**
  - Create a new page or component for user registration.
  - Design and implement a user-friendly form with fields for `email` and `password`.
  - Add client-side validation for email format and password strength.
  - Handle form submission, sending data to the backend's `/api/auth/register` endpoint.
  - Display success messages upon successful registration and navigate to the login page.
  - Display error messages for failed registration attempts (e.g., email already exists, invalid input).
- **Login Page (`/login`):**
  - Create a new page or component for user login.
  - Design and implement a form with fields for `email` and `password`.
  - Handle form submission, sending data to the backend's `/api/auth/login` endpoint.
  - Upon successful login, store the received authentication token/session identifier (e.g., in `localStorage`, cookies).
  - Redirect the user to the main application feed (`/`).
  - Display error messages for failed login attempts (e.g., invalid credentials).
- **Logout Functionality:**
  - Implement a logout button/link accessible to authenticated users.
  - Upon clicking logout, send a request to the backend's `/api/auth/logout` endpoint.
  - Clear any stored authentication tokens/sessions from the frontend.
  - Redirect the user to the login page or a public home page.
- **Routing and Protected Routes:**
  - Configure frontend routing to handle `/register`, `/login`, and the main application routes.
  - Implement basic route protection to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected parts of the application (e.g., the feed).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can access dedicated registration and login pages.
- Users can successfully register and are redirected to the login page.
- Users can successfully log in and are redirected to the main feed.
- Authentication tokens/sessions are securely handled on the client-side.
- Authenticated users can successfully log out.
- Unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes.
